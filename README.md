| Platform      | Supported      |

| Android      | <span style="color:green">yes</span>     |
| Windows      | <span style="color:green">yes</span>     |
| IOS          | ? (need testing) |
| MacCatalysts | ? (need testing) |

I don't have access to MAC therefore IOS/MACOS is untested, but in theory it should work.
